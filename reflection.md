Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the three constructors -- house constructor, library constructor, and cafe constructor -- as making various constructors with different parameters would allow us to create a building even if we don't have enough information about the building.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The goToFloor() method was a little confusing, as there were various conditions where a person cannot use the elevator and access other floors. However, I think everything worked pretty well at the end.
